Hi! I'm **[Neal Shyam](http://neal.rs)** and I made this on December 14, 2013 in Brooklyn NY.

**[Bossmode](http://nealshyam.com/utm)** only does two things: 

1. It constructs URLs with UTM tag strings.
2. It shortens those URLs for easy sharing.


**[Live Demo](http://nealrs.github.io/UTM-Bossmode/)**

I'm pretty new to Google Analytics, but I was surprised by how few UTM related projects there are on GitHub. Bossmode has already saved me a lot of time at my **[new gig](http://www.challengepost.com)**, so hopefully you'll like it too.

MIT licensed and all that. Pulls, forks, and feedback are greatly appreciated. Thanks!
  
*FYI - sign up for & plug in your own bit.ly API key. Link shortening won't work without it.*
